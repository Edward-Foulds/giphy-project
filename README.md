## Developing

### Built With

HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Sass
Parcel

### Building

To compile and build the project, run the following commands in your terminal:

```shell
npm run build
```

### Deploying / Publishing

give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

Explain what these tests test and why.
